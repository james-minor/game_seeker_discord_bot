## Developing

When pulling from the Repository, you will have to build the Virtual Environment from
the `requirements.txt` file. To build the Virtual Environment run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate your `requirements.txt` file from an **existing version** of the repository, run:

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
